# IOT1026-Assignment-4

Write a description of the project here and don't forget to update the badges. 
IRobot : 

This project is using command desing, where it can receive commands and can perform certain actions.

we have to make use of predefined commands like: OnCommand, OffCommand, NorthCommand, SouthCommand, WestCommand and EastCommand.

We also created a new class that implemented IRobotCommand Interface.  

Also, there's a RobotTester class where it provides an interactive interface for users to input command and observe robot's behaviour.

We added commands which made the robot moved in specific direction as mentioned earlier like west, south, north, east, west and also turning on and off.
